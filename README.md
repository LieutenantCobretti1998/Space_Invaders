# Space Invaders Clone

"This Space Invaders clone marks my first significant venture into game development, undertaken as a personal project for educational purposes. Over the past 10 months, I have been immersing myself in Python, and this game, built using Python and Pygame, represents a major milestone in my learning journey. While I have previously created much more smaller game using the Turtle module (Breakout Game), this project stands as my first full-fledged game, showcasing my growing skills and understanding of Python in a fun and interactive way. As my proficiency continues to evolve, I am excited to further enhance and refine this game, embracing the challenges and learning opportunities that come with software development."

## Features

- Modern Space Invaders gameplay. In the next versions I will ad new levels enemies and the option to modify or by new ships.
- Customizable settings for screen resolution,controls and music volume.
- Score tracking and high score saving. 
- Simple and intuitive interface with health, ammo, and current/ highest scores.
